# Open Trivia App

This project uses the [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to fetch API parameters, true or false  and 10 questions, at random from the API database. This is then used to create a simple interactable Ttinker GUI App which can be interacted and played, with scores.

#### API Documentation:
- [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

#### API Endpoint:
- **URL**: [Trivia API JSON File](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=boolean)

## Modules/Libraries

- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the API.
- `tkinter`: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). It provides windows, buttons, labels, and other UI elements for user interaction.
- `html`: Provides utilities for handling HTML content, such as escaping or unescaping special characters (e.g., converting &quot; to "). It helps in properly displaying or processing HTML-encoded text.
